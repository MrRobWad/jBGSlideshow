{"name":"jBGSlideshow","tagline":"jQuery Background Image Slideshow Plugin","body":"### Finally! A jQuery slideshow plugin based on background images!\r\nIf you're at all experienced with jQuery galleries and modern web design, you know how frustrating it can be to implement a photo gallery using background images... there aren't many options out there. This is why I created this jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\n### Background Image Based Rotating Image Gallery\r\nSimply define your container (or the whole body tag), pass in some images and optional links, set a pause time and you're done! This plugin will apply automatically rotating background images to your container. This is very useful for hero images, homepage galleries, splash pages, and more.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```\r\n\t$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\t\t$('body').jBGslideshow({\r\n\t\t\tpausetime: 3000,\r\n\t\t\tpreloadimages: true,\r\n\t\t\timages: {\r\n\t\t\t\t'img/01.png': '',\r\n\t\t\t\t'img/02.png': 'http://www.google.com',\r\n\t\t\t\t'img/04.png': ''\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tselectedslide: 0\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\nOptions include starting slide, pause time, and whether to preload images. Images are passed in as an object with optional links.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nLink functionality is being worked on. It is suggested to NOT pass in links at this time, but rather just empty strings.\r\n\r\nComing soon:\r\nAbility to auto generate clickable 'indicators'\r\nAbility to shuffle the image rotation\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2013, Robert Waddell (@mrrobwad)\r\nhttp://mrrobwad.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
